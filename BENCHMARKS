main.sh 

BLAST benchmark:

Time to run blast will go roughly as N^2 where N is the number
of organisms (assuming they have roughly the same number of genes)
and as k^2 where k is the number of genes per organism.

Running on 12 (reasonably fast) cores BLASTP took on average
somewhere around 6 seconds per pair of organisms... so on my test set
of 69 organisms it took

69^2 * 6 seconds * 1 min/60 sec * 1 hour / 60 min = 8 hours

to run BLASTP all vs. all. The algorithm is embarassingly parallel,
so scale up or down according to the number of cores you have.

BLASTN all vs. all takes less time but will still be in the hours+
range for a reasonably large number of genomes.
On the same machine (using 12 cores of processing) it took about 
1.5 seconds per pair of organisms.

69^2 * 1.5 * 1/60 * 1/60 = 2 hours

Loading up the SQLite database took about 2 hours beyond these steps.
This will roughly increase as O(N^2) as well (depending on the number
of BLAST hits between each pair of organisms, whcih could vary wildly).
Unlike BLAST, this step is not parallelized.

Everything else done in main.sh is completely insignificant in time
compared to the BLAST computation and data loading steps.

MCL benchmark:

Running MCL on all BLAST hits with 69 organisms took about
[TODO: How long?]
