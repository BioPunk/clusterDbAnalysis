main.sh 

BLAST benchmark:

Time to run blast will go roughly as N^2 where N is the number
of organisms (assuming they have roughly the same number of genes)
and as k^2 where k is the number of genes per organism.

Running on 12 (reasonably fast) cores BLASTP took on average
somewhere around 6 seconds per pair of organisms... so on my test set
of 69 organisms it took

69^2 * 6 seconds * 1 min/60 sec * 1 hrou / 60 min = 8 hours

to run BLASTP all vs. all. The algorithm is embarassingly parallel,
so scale up or down according to the number of cores you have.

BLASTN all vs. all takes less time but will still be in the hours+
range. The scaling rules are the same.

Loading up the SQLite database took about 4 hours beyond these steps.
This will roughly increase as O(N^2) as well (depending on the number
of BLAST hits between each pair of organisms, whcih could vary wildly).
Unlike BLAST, this step is not parallelized.

Everything else done in main.sh is completely insignificant in time
compared to these two steps.

MCL benchmark:

Running MCL on all BLAST hits with 69 organisms took about
