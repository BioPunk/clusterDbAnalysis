Files included in this folder ($ROOT):

These scripts should be run in the following order to set up the database,
once all of the input data is placed correctly.

main.sh - Backs up existing organisms file, generates a new one from the genbank files, and reconciles abbreviations.
	  Checks formatting of input files and throws an error if something is inconsistent.
          Adds organisms to the raw files in $ROOT/raw/ using the data in the "organisms" file.
          (Optionally) adds aliases in $ROOT/aliases/aliases file to the annotations if that file exists.
          Set up fasta files and BLAST databases from the raw files in $ROOT/raw (NOT from the genbank files).
          Runs BLASTP and BLASTN all vs. all and dumps the results into a sqlite database $ROOT/db/Database.SQLite
main2.sh - Runs clustering with the specified parameters (cutoff, inflation value and method\metric for clustering).
              The subset of organisms to cluster is specified in the "groups" file.
           Processes the clustering results into a flat table format for input into the database.	   
main3.sh - Parses Genbank files in the genbank/ folder to get whole-genome nucleotide sequences.
	 Adds the sequences to the datbase (WARNING: Do not do this for human-sized genomes!)

Other files:

addGroupByMatch.py - Given a key or a set of keys, searches through the organisms file for all of the organism names matching
		   at least one of the provided keys, and adds all the matching organisms to a new group in the groups file.
		   Example: ./addGroupByMatch.py -o organisms -g groups -n Escherichia_and_shigella "Escherichia" "Shigella"
		   would make a new group called "Escherichia_and_shigella" containing all organisms matching either "Escherichia" or
		   "Shigella" in part of their names.
checkInputFormat.sh - Check for existence of required input files (genbank files in genbank/, raw files in raw/)
		    Check format of the organism file and of the organism IDs within the organisms file.
		    Fast check for format of the raw files (not a complete check but should catch many errors)
		    Check that each organism ID in the organism file is represented in at least one raw file
dumpDocumentation.sh - Automatically generate documentation files for scripts in src/ and in scripts/ and save it to doc/
generateOrganismFileFromGbk.sh - This function is meant for internal use. It will delete the existing organism file and replace it
			       with one automatically generated from the genbank files (it looks for the field /organism="[organismname]"
			       and pulls out the organism name from that, and gets the organism ID from the file name)
removeOrganism.sh - Remove all traces of the specified organism, including BLAST results, raw data and genbank file, all clusters 
		      containining the specified gene, etc. 
		  By default, lists what files and\or lines from data files would be deleted. 
		  If you specify "TRUE" as an argument, actually performs the deletion.

$ROOT/aliases/: Folder in which alias tables should be placed if available
$ROOT/doc/: Software documentation (including installation directions)
$ROOT/genbank/: Location for all GENBANK files (see /doc/INSTALL for details)
$ROOT/raw/: Location for all RAW files (see /doc/INSTALL for details)
$ROOT/scripts/: Contains "dead-end" \ convenient wrapper scripts to do common analysis tasks.
$ROOT/src/: Contains modules that can be executed after loading up the data using main scripts.

Folders created by the main scripts:

$ROOT/db/: Contains the SQLite database and tables used as sources for that database
$ROOT/faa/: Protein FASTA files (generated from raw files for each organism) and their compiled BLAST databases.
$ROOT/flatclusters: "Flattened" cluster files - runID and clusterID assigned to each cluster and put into a database-friendly format.
$ROOT/fna/: Nucleotide (gene) FASTA files (generated from raw files for each organism) and their compiled BLAST databases.
$ROOT/modtable/: Raw tables reformatted for input into database. Obsolete?
