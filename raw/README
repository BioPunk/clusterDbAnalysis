IMPORTANT: make sure you put all of your RAW data files
in this folder!

If you want to be able to REMOVE the organism later you should name the files with the format
[organismID].txt . This is because files to remove are identified by the organism ID in the file name.

e.g. 83333.1.txt for E. coli K12

RAW data files are tab-delmited files that look like this:

contig_id       feature_id      type    location        start   stop    strand  function        aliases figfam  evidence_codes  nucleotide_sequence     aa_sequence

You have three options in this package for generating these files (roughly in order of preference):

1: You can run your own genome in RAST and download the tab-delmited file, which has exactly this format.
2: If you know the PubSEED genome identifier (i.e. 83333.1 for E. coli) you can run the Pubseed2Rast.sh to
automatically download the tab-delimited file from PubSEED and then convert it into RAST format.
3: You can download the .gff, .fna, and .faa files from the NCBI FTP server and run Ncbi2Rast.py to convert it
(make sure to heed any warnings about things I couldn't match up - those will probably have to be added yourself).

Only proteins should be considered - RNAs (i.e. tRNAs, rRNAs) are ignored.
