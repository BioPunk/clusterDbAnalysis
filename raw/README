IMPORTANT: make sure you put all of your RAW data files
in this folder!

RAW data files are tab-delmited files that look like this:

contig_id       feature_id      type    location        start   stop    strand  function        aliases figfam  evidence_codes  nucleotide_sequence     aa_sequence

#############################
# FILE NAMING REQURIEMENTS  #
#############################

The file must be named:

[organismID].txt 

The organism ID must match the regex "\d+\.\d+" (or "[0-9]+\.[0-9]+").
e.g. 83333.1

#############################
# FIELD REQUIREMENTS        #
#############################

The first number in the organism ID (83333.1) should be the TaxID for the
organism. The second number is arbitrary.

The feature_id in the raw file must match the regex:
"fig\|\d+\.\d+\.peg\.\d+"

e.g. fig|83333.1.peg.1

The first two numbers in this regex (i.e. 83333.1) must match the organism ID in the file name.
  Feature IDs must be unique across the whole database (i.e. don't restart ID numbers for each contig).

The "type" for every protein-encoding gene must be the string "peg".
  Any other type (including RNAs) is not well-supported by the software at this time.

Start and stop: The start location is 1-indexed (first nucleotide in the contig is 1)
  The start location is defined as the first translated nucleotide (often an A in ATG) - this means
  start > stop for "-"-strand genes and start < stop for "+"-strand genes.

nucleotide_sequence is the nucleotide sequence of only the coding region (if there is splicing,
  use only the coding part of the gene and give alternate splicing variants different feature IDs)

aa_sequence should be the translation of the nucleotide sequence.

The "location", "aliases", "figfam", and "evidence_codes" fields are ignored (these are outputs from
RAST that are not needed for database construction). You can put whatever you want there but need
placeholder strings if nothing is there.

See INSTALL in the root directory for instructions on how to generate these files.
