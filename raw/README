IMPORTANT: make sure you put all of your RAW data files
in this folder!

If you want to be able to REMOVE the organism later you should name the files with the format
[organismID].txt . This is because files to remove are identified by the organism ID in the file name.

e.g. 83333.1.txt for E. coli K12

RAW data files are tab-delmited files that look like this:

contig_id       feature_id      type    location        start   stop    strand  function        aliases figfam  evidence_codes  nucleotide_sequence     aa_sequence

Only proteins should be considered - RNAs (i.e. tRNAs, rRNAs) are ignored.

See INSTALL in the root directory for instructions on how to generate these files.
