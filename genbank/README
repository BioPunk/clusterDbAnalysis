### GENBANK Readme file
#

This folder is intended to contain Genbank files for any organisms
for which you want to run functions that depend on having the whole genome
sequence available. As of the time of writing this includes:

- TBLASTN analysis
- Identification and analysis of upstream regions of genes

The clustering analysis itself does NOT depend on genbank files.

To put the information in the database required for these analysis, first
put genbank files in this folder and then run ./main3.sh from the root folder
of this distribution. This function parses out the necessary info and puts
the genome nucleotide sequences into the database.

There is no fundamental need to put in the genomes for all organisms - but
if you try to run one of the analysis scripts that requires a genome that isn't
present you will get an error.

NAMING REQUIREMENTS:

In order to match up the genome with its proteins, it is necessary to
name the genbank files with the organism ID in the file name.

For example:

83333.1.gbk

would be the filename for E. coli. It doesn't matter what else is in there as long
as the genome ID is there; the genome ID is extracted from the file name using a regex
that it must match (this is the same requirement as elsewhere in the package):

grep -P -o "\d+\.\d+"
