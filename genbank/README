### GENBANK Readme file
#

This folder is intended to contain Genbank files. We now require genbank
files for every organism because they are needed to automatically generate
intermediates and also for TBLASTN and other whole-genome analyses.

To put the whole-genome info into the database, first
put genbank files in this folder and then run ./main3.sh from the root folder
of this distribution. This function parses out the necessary info and puts
the genome nucleotide sequences into the database.

#############################
#  FILE NAMING REQUIREMENTS #
#############################

File names must have the format

[organismid].gbk 

The organism ID must match the regex "\d+\.\d+" (or [0-9]+\.[0-9]+).
The first number must be the tax ID specified in the genbank file. 
The second number is arbitrary.

For example:

83333.1.gbk

would be the filename for E. coli.

The organism ID must match an organism ID in at least one raw file.

#############################
# WHAT MUST BE IN THE FILES #
#############################

Fundamentally, the program requires the following fields from the genbank files. 
Everything else is ignored (including any gene IDs, sequences, etc. - they are
imported to the database from the raw file instead).

- /organism="[organism name]" : Used to generate the organisms file
- /dbxref="taxid:[taxid]" : Used to check consistency with the organism ID. The first number in the
  organism ID should be the taxID.
- A LOCUS field containing a contig name (without spaces but length does not matter). The contig 
  name must be consistent with the contig name in the raw file.
- The contig's sequence.

If you have multiple contigs (or multiple chromosomes, or a chromosome and a plasmid, etc.), 
you should concatinate the genbank files for each one into a single file with a name consistent
with the file naming requirements above.
