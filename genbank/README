Add genbank files here

The requirements for the genbank files:

- Contig name must not have a space [This is so that we can go more than 10 characters]
- Each contig must have its own LOCUS line. The way I did this means that if you downloaded
the genbank files from NCBI, you can concatinate them and it'll still work fine.

Formatting requirements: The only things the parser looks for are these:

LOCUS Contig_name_no_spaces [Other stuff]
ORIGIN
  [Numbers optional]  acttttca aaaagga gat
//

Numbers and spaces are stripped out of the sequence (between ORIGIN and the //).
Anything else (e.g. gaps, *, etc.) is left in.
There has to be a newline between ORIGIN and the start of the sequence.
The number of spaces between LOCUS and the contig name does not matter.

The genbank files are optional for clustering / BLASTP / neighborhood analysis
but required for TBLASTN and other functions that require
you to have a genome.

Genbank files can be automatically converted to genome-fasta files
(the parser is really dumb but it does well enough and doesn't
care if the contig name is more than 10 characters)
